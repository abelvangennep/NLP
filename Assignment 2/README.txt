This project contains code for assignment 2 of the course Natural Language Processing Technology 2022 at VU Amsterdam put together by Lisa Beinborn.

References:
In this assignment, the dataset is OLIDv1, which contains 13,240 annotated tweets for offensive language detection. This dataset was used in the SemEval 2019 shared task on offensive language detection (OffensEval 2019).
 
We will focus on Subtask A (identify whether a tweet is offensive or not). 

It has been simplified and adapted by Lisa Beinborn.


Your task:

- For part A of the assignment, fine-tune BERT for offensive language detection.
- For part B of the assignment, error analysis with checklist.
- For part C of the assignment, creating examples from scratch with checklist.

Your code will not be graded but it should be well documented and support the results of your submission. Your submission is only complete with the code. We will sporadically check the completeness and quality of the code.
